Welcome to my digital garden — a place that grows rather than launches.

Unlike a blog with polished posts, a garden is a living collection of notes at different stages of maturity. Some are seeds (rough ideas), some are budding, and some are evergreen.

## Why a garden?

I find that the pressure of publishing "finished" work stops me from writing at all. A garden removes that pressure. Notes can be incomplete. They can link to each other. They can change.

## How this works

Each note lives at `/en/[slug]`. You can browse by tag or follow links between notes. External links include a click counter so you can see which references I find most useful — and apparently so do readers.

If you highlight any text and leave a comment, it will show up here once I approve it. I'd love to know which ideas resonate.
