Note-taking is deeply personal. What works for one person is friction for another. After years of switching tools, here is what I've landed on.

## Capture fast, process later

The most important thing is removing the barrier to capture. I write in whatever is open — a notes app, a paper notebook, the back of a receipt. The goal is to not lose the thought.

Processing happens later, in a dedicated session. That's when I move raw captures into this garden.

## The three states of a note

1. **Seed** — a raw idea, just captured. Might be a single sentence.
2. **Budding** — I've thought about it more, added context, maybe linked it to other notes.
3. **Evergreen** — a stable, well-developed piece that I return to and refine over time.

Most notes never become evergreen, and that's fine.

## Linking over hierarchy

Folders create false certainty about where an idea belongs. Links let an idea belong in multiple places simultaneously. That's closer to how I actually think.

## Tools I use

- Plain Markdown files for longevity
- This garden for the networked layer
- A simple text file as an inbox
